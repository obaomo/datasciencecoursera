An intro to whom i'm.

I'm excellent at analyzing, understanding, and learning. i tend to be mystical, philosophers, scholars and teachers.
Because i live so much in my mind, I tend to be quiet and introspective, and are usually introverts. when presented with issues, i'll see tyhe big picture. my solitary thoughtfulness andanalysis of people and events around, make me aloof and sometimes even melancholjy.
