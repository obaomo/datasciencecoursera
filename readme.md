An intro to who I'am!

I'm excellent at analyzing, understanding, and learning. I tend to be mystical, philosopher, scholar and teacher.
Because I live so much in my mind, I tend to be quiet and introspective, usually also an introverts. when presented with issues, I'll see the big picture. my solitary thoughtfulness and analysis of people and events around, make me aloof and sometimes even melancholy. I could answer almost all of your questions, but I can't solve the puzzle of your typical mind and dreams. I like to maintain balance in everything including live, laugh and love. I love to captivate you and this a chance that you will not be able to get out of my spell power. Even when you try to hard to back off, I,ll definitely convince you with such persuasive arguments that you would be left with no other option, but to understand me more clearly. I'll cover the contradictions of my behavior with such charm that you will be entrapped once upon a time again, with nowhere to go.
