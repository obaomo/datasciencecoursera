An intro to whom i'm.

I'm excellent at analyzing, understanding, and learning. I tend to be mystical, philosopher, scholar and teacher.
Because I live so much in my mind, I tend to be quiet and introspective, usually also an introverts. when presented with issues, I'll see the big picture. my solitary thoughtfulness and analysis of people and events around, make me aloof and sometimes even melancholy. I could answer almost all of your questions, but I can't solve the puzzle of your typical mind and dreams. I like to maitain balance in everything including the 3 L's which are live, laugh and love.
